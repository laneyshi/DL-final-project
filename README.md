# DL-final-project
# simulation_algo.py
Compare DP-DQN and other three benchmark, data is automatically saved as .mat file.
To obtain the corrsponding figure, just run the .m files in \matlab_code\plot_code\algo.

# simulation_device.py
Compare the influence of the number of different devices on the performance of the system. The data are recorded in advance and directly saved in the .m files.
To obtain the corrsponding figure, just run the .m files in \matlab_code\plot_code\device.

# simulation_hyper_softreplace.py
Compare the influence brought by hyper parameters to the system performance and convergence, data is automatically saved as .mat file.
To obtain the corrsponding figure, just run the .m files in \matlab_code\plot_code\hyper.
